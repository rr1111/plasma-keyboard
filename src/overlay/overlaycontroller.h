/**
 * Central controller for overlay popups (diacritics, emoji, text expansion).

 * Manages trigger registration, event dispatch, overlay lifecycle, and candidate population.
 * This class bridges C++ input handling with QML overlay views.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Register triggers with registerTrigger()
 * 2. Feed input events via processKeyPress/Release/PreeditChanged/TextCommitted
 * 3. Connect to overlayRequested/overlayClosed signals in QML
 * 4. Call commitCandidate() when user selects an option
